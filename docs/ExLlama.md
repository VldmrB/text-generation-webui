# ExLlama

## About

ExLlama is an extremely optimized GPTQ backend for LLaMA models. It features much lower VRAM usage and much higher speeds due to not relying on unoptimized transformers code.

## Installation:

1) Clone the ExLlama repository into your `text-generation-webui/repositories` folder:

```
mkdir repositories
cd repositories
git clone https://github.com/turboderp/exllama
```

2) Follow the remaining set up instructions in the official README: https://github.com/turboderp/exllama#exllama
